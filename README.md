## Installation

Before the app will run on your computer you will first need to run an npm install for both Inquirer and JS dependencies. 


## Usage 

Once you navigate to the appropriate folder in your terminal, simply input "node app" for the prompts to begin. You will start by entering the employee's name, role, employee ID, email address and a few other pieces of information related to the employee's role. Once you finish adding all your employees the HTML file will be automatically generated. 

You can locate your generated HTML file in the output folder. Open the file in your local browser to see your clean employee list.
